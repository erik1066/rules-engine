# Business Rules Engine for .NET Core

This library is a C# / .NET Core rewrite of the Java [Business Rules Engine](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-rules-engine) by Ben Chevallereau. The Business Rules Engine is an open source project written for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. See https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-rules-engine/blob/master/AUTHORS.

The "business rules" are written in Json; see the [FDNS Rules Engine GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-rules-engine) for rule syntax examples.

This an early prototype meant for testing different ways of implementing the library in .NET Core and is _not_ representative of a production-ready product. Do not use in production systems.
